Set up env for code
Install python 3.10 in conda env 
$conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.10.16
Then install python packages with
$pip install tensorflow==2.14.1 tensorflow-probability==0.22.1 qutip==4.7.6 matplotlib psutil numpy scipy pandas qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime qiskit-aer qiskit-experiments

Alternatively you should be able to use any other virtual python environment 
with the same python version and pip install command

Removing env: 
$conda remove --name ENV_NAME --all


#python 3.11 will cause a massive memory leak.
#Newer tensorflow versions require keras 3 which doesn't work with older networks and seems to be 2x slower (due to different standard tracing settings?)
